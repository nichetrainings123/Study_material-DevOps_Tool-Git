In my projects, we follow a structured Git branching strategy to ensure smooth parallel development and controlled releases. The main branch always contains stable, production-ready code, while the develop branch serves as the integration branch where all features are tested before release. For every new feature or bug fix, developers create a separate feature branch from develop, allowing isolated work without affecting others. Once the feature is complete and tested, it’s merged back into develop. Before deployment, a release branch is created from develop for final testing and version tagging; once validated, it’s merged into both main and develop to keep history consistent. In case of critical production issues, we create a hotfix branch directly from main to apply immediate fixes and merge it back into both main and develop. This branching strategy ensures continuous integration, stability of production code, and faster delivery in a DevOps pipeline.
